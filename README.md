# AI-enabled-ESG-Cloud-Analytics-Solution

In the 2024 TCS UK Hackathon, I led a team to design GREENI-FI, an AI-powered cloud analytics platform aimed at decarbonizing Aegon UK’s investment portfolio. The project responded to a critical challenge of accurately measuring the carbon footprint of financed emissions, reconciling climate risk data, and aligning with UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR).

As team leader, leveraging free version of project management softwares like Jira and Confluece, I facilitated the development process using agile methodologies and design thinking to identify business pain points and innovate business value-oreinted digital solution. The platform was designed with speculated capabilities of AI-enabled data ingestion pipelines, real-time monitoring, and ETL processes for seamless data cleansing and standardization. Tools like Python for machine learning, cloud services for hosting, and Power BI for visualization were central to the build.

The team’s efforts culminated in a scalable platform capable of tracking financed emissions and generating compliance-ready ESG reports. As observed and commended by Judges, this end-to-end analytics Solutions addresses gaps in data reconciliation and the need for automated KPI tracking, leading to cost reduction, streamlined operations, and enhanced regulatory compliance for Aegon UK.

This project harnessed my team leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and technical innovation both during interactive online webinars with TCS UK Team and Domain Experts and during project work with team applying desging thinking into practice to address a significant environmental challenge.
